Ember.js for Polish students

***

This tutorial provides an introduction to the Ember.js - a framework for creating ambitious web applications. We'll build a simple web app using Ember and Node as a runtime environment for JavaScript. Before we'll start make sure that you've got a working knowledge of:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
It would be great if you know something about an ECMAScript 6 syntax. That's the newest standard of JavaScript and our framework uses it.
